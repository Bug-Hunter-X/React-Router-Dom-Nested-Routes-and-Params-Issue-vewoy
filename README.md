# React Router Dom Nested Routes and Params Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using nested routes and parameters in React Router Dom.  The issue involves unexpected rendering behavior or complete failure to render routes correctly, particularly when navigating between routes with dynamic parameters.

## Problem Description

The primary problem is that when navigating between different routes with parameters in a nested routing structure, the application might render incorrectly, fail to update the view, or show unexpected content.  This problem is particularly subtle and can be difficult to diagnose due to the lack of clear error messages.  The bug might manifest differently depending on the complexity of the route structure.

## Solution

The solution usually involves carefully reviewing the route definitions, ensuring parameters are correctly handled, and potentially restructuring the routing hierarchy to avoid ambiguity or conflicts.  Additional techniques, such as using route guards or custom components to manage state transitions, might be necessary in more complex scenarios.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Navigate between the `/` and `/about` routes to observe the potentially erratic behavior.
